#### Transforming Software Development with Generative AI

Generative AI marks a new era in software engineering, reshaping how developers **learn, plan, create, deploy, and manage applications**.  
This session highlighted how AI-driven development enables:

- Automation of repetitive engineering tasks
- Rapid prototyping and faster delivery cycles
- Improved code quality and security through AI-assisted reviews
- A shift toward higher-value, design-focused work for developers

#### AI in the Software Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)

The session introduced how AI tools integrate across the entire SDLC:

- Architecture planning
- Code generation and refactoring
- Test case creation and validation
- Deployment pipelines
- Maintenance and monitoring

Through Amazon Q Developer and Kiro, participants gained clarity on how AI elevates developer capabilities.
