### Event Objectives

- Introduce participants to GenAI-powered problem-solving through an interactive GameDay experience
- Provide hands-on exposure to **Amazon Bedrock**, **AgentCore**, **Knowledge Bases**, **Guardrails**, and **MCP**
- Help players understand how AI agents collaborate with AWS services in real-world workflows
- Encourage teamwork across mixed skill levels to strengthen learning and problem-solving strategies
- Demonstrate how serverless, database, and search services integrate with GenAI applications
- Create a fun and engaging environment where participants earn points through missions, puzzles, and challenges

### AWS Services Used

- **Amazon Bedrock** (Foundation Models, Knowledge Bases, Guardrails)
- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** (Runtime, Memory, Code Interpreter, Observability)
- **Strands Agents**
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
- **Amazon DynamoDB**
- **Amazon OpenSearch Serverless**
- **Amazon Q Developer for CLI**

### Target Audience

Secret Agent(ic) AI GameDay is designed for a **broad range of roles**—including data scientists, ML practitioners, architects, developers, and operations engineers.  
Participants should:

- Be familiar with navigating the **AWS Console**
- Benefit from teamwork across different skill levels
- Not require programming expertise (helpful but optional)
- Be encouraged to form teams mixing **Beginners**, **Intermediates**, and **Experts** for maximum collaboration

### Difficulty

Each team should ideally contain **3–5 members** with varied skills:

- 1–2 **Experts**
- 1–2 **Intermediate** participants
- 1–2 **Beginners**

This ensures balanced collaboration and allows players to learn from each other.

### Key Highlights

#### GenAI-Powered Adventure

The event transforms GenAI learning into an interactive mission where teams operate as **Secret Agents** tasked with solving challenges using AI agents, databases, knowledge retrieval, and observability tools.  
Instead of traditional lectures, participants progress through:

- Missions
- Time-limited puzzles
- Evidence analysis
- Incremental point-based challenges

This unique format enhances both **technical learning** and **team dynamics**.

#### Hands-On Experience with Bedrock & AgentCore

Players interact with several cutting-edge GenAI services:

- Using **Foundation Models** for natural-language reasoning
- Retrieving facts and evidence with **Knowledge Bases**
- Ensuring safety and correctness with **Guardrails**
- Running multi-step agents using **AgentCore Runtime & Memory**
- Observing agent behavior, debugging, and tracing
- Storing mission data in **DynamoDB**
- Using **OpenSearch Serverless** for advanced retrieval

These concepts mirror real-world AI workloads but are presented in a fun, gamified environment.

#### Team Collaboration & Strategy

Success requires:

- Clear communication
- Division of roles
- Shared note-taking and knowledge tracking
- Fast troubleshooting
- Adaptability

Teams earn points not only for completing missions but also for **efficiency**, **creativity**, and **technical accuracy**.
