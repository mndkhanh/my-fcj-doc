### Event Objectives

- Introduce participants to modern DevOps principles and culture
- Provide practical knowledge of AWS DevOps tools across CI/CD, infrastructure, and operations
- Demonstrate how DevOps accelerates delivery through automation, observability, and continuous improvement
- Equip developers with hands-on insights into containerization, monitoring, and deployment strategies
- Strengthen understanding of reliability, scalability, and operational excellence on AWS
- Support participants in exploring DevOps career development and AWS certification pathways

### Speakers

- **AWS Vietnam DevOps Specialist Team**
- **Guest Trainers from AWS Training & Certification**

### Key Highlights

#### Embracing the DevOps Mindset

The workshop began with a discussion about the evolving shift toward a DevOps-centric culture. Participants were introduced to:

- The principles of DevOps collaboration
- Key performance metrics (DORA metrics: Deployment Frequency, MTTR, Change Failure Rate)
- The importance of automation and continuous improvement
- How DevOps complements AI/ML workflows from previous sessions

This session emphasized how a strong DevOps culture leads to faster delivery, higher reliability, and stronger engineering ownership.

#### A Deep Dive into AWS DevOps Tooling

Throughout the full-day workshop, participants explored AWS-native tools for CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, container orchestration, and observability—gaining a solid understanding of how modern engineering teams build and deliver applications at scale.
