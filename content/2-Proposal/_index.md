# APT Magic

## A Serverless AI Platform for Personalized Image Generation and Social Interaction

### 1. Executive Summary

**APT Magic** is a serverless AI-powered web application designed to enable users to generate, personalize, and share artistic content such as AI-generated images. The platform integrates with AI foundation models via **Amazon Bedrock** and provides a seamless web experience using **Next.js (SSR)** hosted on **AWS Amplify**.

The MVP version focuses on real-time image generation and sharing, while the **Future Design** aims to scale with **Bedrock agentCore/SageMaker Inference**, **SQS/SNS**, **Secret Manager & CloudTrail** and **AWS MLOps pipelines** for advanced model orchestration and automation.

APT Magic is currently developed as a modern, cost-efficient, and secure AWS-native architecture for small to medium user bases, with planned expansion into enterprise-grade AI orchestration.

### 2. Problem Statement

#### What’s the Problem?

Most AI image generation platforms are costly, rely on opaque third-party APIs, and offer limited personalization.  
Developers and creators often face high latency, lack of transparent model management, and limited control over user data security.

#### The Solution

APT Magic leverages **AWS serverless architecture** to deliver:

- Real-time AI image generation through **Amazon Bedrock Stability AI** models.
- Secure user authentication and content management using **Amazon Cognito** and **DynamoDB**.
- Scalable API handling via **AWS Lambda** and **API Gateway**.
- Low-latency global delivery with **CloudFront CDN** and **WAF protection**.

Future upgrades will include **SQS/SNS decoupling**, **Bedrock AgentCore/SageMaker Inference pipelines**, and cost-efficient CI/CD via **CloudFormation**. transforming APT Magic into a fully automated MLOps platform.

### 3. Solution Architecture

#### **MVP Architecture**

The MVP is a **fully serverless architecture**, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness.

**Core AWS Services:**

- **Route53 + CloudFront + WAF** — Secure global access and caching.
- **Amplify (Next.js SSR)** — Hosts the frontend and server-side rendering layer.
- **API Gateway + Lambda Functions** — Manage backend logic (image processing, subscription, post APIs).
- **Amazon Cognito** — User authentication and access control.
- **Amazon S3 + DynamoDB** — Data persistence and image storage.
- **Amazon Bedrock** — Integrates foundation model (Stability AI) for image generation.
- **CloudWatch** — Logging, and monitoring.

**Security**

- **WAF + IAM policies** for traffic filtering and role-based access control.

#### **Future Design (Enhanced Architecture)**

In the next phase, APT Magic will evolve into an **AI orchestration platform**, introducing new layers for automation, resilience, and model lifecycle management.

**New Services to be Added:**

- **Amazon SQS** — For reliable message queuing between async Lambda tasks.
- **Amazon SNS** — For real-time event notifications to users or administrators.
- **Amazon ElastiCache (Redis)** — For rate limiting and caching of frequent inference requests.
- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** — For hosting custom fine-tuned models and managing model endpoints.

- **CI/CD**
  - **CloudFormation** for infrastructure deployment and automation.
